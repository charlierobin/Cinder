# My messing around with a fork of the Cinder C++/OpenGL library

I thought I would start by adding some extra blend modes (to the original Blend that already ships with it) to the cinder::ip module.

Some of them work correctly, others are works in progress:

`Add`

`Color`

`Darken`

`Difference`

`Divide`

`Hue`

`Lighten`

`Luminosity`

`Multiply`

`Saturation`

`Screen`

`Subtract`


Originally inspired by a need for “Screen” when I was mucking around with lens flare effects. (And yes, they are supposed to match, as closely as possible, the Adobe Photoshop/After Effects layer modes.)

... where there’s all the code, pre-packaged bits and pieces, examples, learning materials etc. Lots of good stuff!
